# Functions

Welcome to my functions repo, here you will find the relevant assignments from STAT545B

I have only started with Assignment B-1 so far, meaning in this repo you will find the `Assignment_B_1.Rmd` file and it's associated markdown knitted output. Please check back in the future to see more updates!

To run the code found in this repo, simply clone the project or the file into your own repository and run through R-studio.
