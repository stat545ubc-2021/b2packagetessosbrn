# Functions

Welcome to my functions repo, here you will find the relevant assignments from STAT545B

### File contents

I have only started with Assignment B-1 so far, meaning in this repo you will find the `Assignment_B_1.Rmd` file and it's associated markdown knitted output. Please check back in the future to see more updates!

### Running the code

The code written in this repository will all be contained in .Rmd files, which you are able to copy or clone into R studio and run from there. These files are written to output as github markdown documents (`output = github_document`), please alter this output if you would like to see it in a different document type
